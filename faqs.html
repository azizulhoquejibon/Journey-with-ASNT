              <p >Deciding on a name for your blog is probably one of the hardest parts of blogging.

                Even if you know exactly what you want to blog about and have some articles written, deciding on your blog’s name may be stopping you from actually creating your website and launching it.
                
                I don’t exactly remember how I came up with Making Sense of Cents, but I remember there being a lot of brainstorming involved.
                
                Coming up with a blog name shouldn’t lead to stress, so here are my tips for deciding on a blog name:
                
                1.Make it easy. My blog name isn’t the easiest for people to spell, and even I sometimes jumble it when I’m spelling it. So, my top tip would be to make sure that your blog name is easy for people to type or spell out loud. I’ve seen blog names that are extremely long, contain words that are difficult to spell, and so on. Instead, you should make it as easy as possible for your readers to find you.
                
                2.Think about what you’ll be writing about. Think about the topics you want to write about, who your target audience is, and more, and then jot down descriptive words that are related to each. Brainstorming like this is a good way to come up with a blog name!
                
                3.Use a thesaurus to find similar words. If your first or second choices are taken or if you want to see if there are some catchier-sounding blog names, using a thesaurus can help you with some new ideas.
                
                4.Make it catchy. You may want to think of something funny, use alliteration, or something else to make your blog name catchy and memorable.
                
                5.Use your name. If you don’t want something catchy and/or if you think you’re not creative enough, then just use your name. It’s super easy that way, and more and more people are starting to do this.</p>
